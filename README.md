# Akira アキラ

**Akira** is a minimal, keyboard-driven Linux environment built on top of **Arch Linux** and the **Hyprland** compositor. It embodies a philosophy of precision, control, and clarity — inspired by the aesthetics of Tokyo Night and the spirit of the word *Akira* (明), which means *bright*, *clear*, or *intelligent* in Japanese.

## ✨ Vision

Akira aims to deliver a clean and cohesive computing experience focused on:

- **Keyboard efficiency** – Every action is designed to be accessible without leaving the keyboard.
- **Visual clarity** – A refined Tokyo Night-inspired color palette ensures focus and calmness.
- **System coherence** – Every component follows the same minimal aesthetic.
- **Performance and simplicity** – Built on Arch Linux for users who value speed, control, and transparency.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The Akira visual identity blends **modern minimalism** with **cyberpunk undertones**:

- JetBrains Mono as the default font for both system and UI.
- A palette based on the Tokyo Night scheme, adapted for contrast and readability.
- The kanji **アキラ** stands as the symbolic core — representing clarity in technology and thought.
